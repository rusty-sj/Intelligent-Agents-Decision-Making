# Reinforcement Learning Algorithms with Ray Framework Intel DevCloud

This repository contains implementations of certain crucial algorithms in the field of [reinforcement learning](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html "Sutton & Barto Book: Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction"). 


[Ray Framework](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ "What is Ray? Documentation") and [Intel&reg; AI DevCloud](https://intelsoftwaresites.secure.force.com/devcloud/oneapi) are used to implement distributed versions of the algorithms like Value Iteration, SARSA, Q-learning, and DQN.
